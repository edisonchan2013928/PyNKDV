# PyNKDV: An Efficient Network Kernel Density Visualization Library for Geospatial Analytic Systems

Network kernel density visualization (NKDV) has been widely used in different applications, including traffic/traffic accident hotspot detection and crime hotspot detection. Therefore, many software packages, e.g., spNetwork (an R package) and SANET (a plugin for QGIS/ArcGIS), can also support this tool. However, all these software packages are based on the na√Øve implementation, which are not scalable to large-scale datasets. To overcome this weakness, we propose this python library, called PyNKDV [1], which is based on our state-of-the-art solution (ADA) [8]. PyNKDV can significantly improve the efficiency for generating NKDV compared with existing software packages.

# Usage of PyNKDV
Our PyNKDV library can clearly show hotspots in the commonly used geographic information systems, including QGIS and ArcGIS. In Figure 1, we show the hotspot map for the 311-call location dataset in the Mission District of San Francisco using QGIS. Note that the Capp Street has higher 311-call density compared with the Shotwell Street although these two streets are close to each other in terms of Euclidean distance. This shows that NKDV can provide more accurate visualization compared with the traditional kernel density visualization.
