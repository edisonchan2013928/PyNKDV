# PyNKDV: An Efficient Network Kernel Density Visualization Library for Geospatial Analytic Systems

Network kernel density visualization (NKDV) has been widely used in different applications, including traffic/traffic accident hotspot detection and crime hotspot detection. Therefore, many software packages, e.g., spNetwork (an R package) and SANET (a plugin for QGIS/ArcGIS), can also support this tool. However, all these software packages are based on the na√Øve implementation, which are not scalable to large-scale datasets. To overcome this weakness, we propose this python library, called PyNKDV [1], which is based on our state-of-the-art solution (ADA) [8]. PyNKDV can significantly improve the efficiency for generating NKDV compared with existing software packages.

# Usage of PyNKDV
Our PyNKDV library can clearly show hotspots in the commonly used geographic information systems, including QGIS and ArcGIS. In Figure 1, we show the hotspot map (based on NKDV) for the 311-call location dataset in San Francisco using QGIS. Compared with the scatter plot (cf. Figure 1a), we can clearly observe that there are two 311-call hotspot regions in San Francisco (cf. Figure 1b).

Compared with the commonly used kernel density visualization (KDV) tool, NKDV does not overestimate the density values for some geographical events that lie on/are along with the road network (e.g., traffic accidents and crime events). In Figure 2, we generate KDV and NKDV for the 311-call location dataset in the Mission District of San Francisco. Note that KDV tends to provide higher density (i.e., not safe) for the Shotwell Street, which is deemed to be low density using NKDV (i.e., safe).

PyNKDV also offers the bandwidth tuning operation for domain experts to generate multiple NKDVs based on different bandwidth parameters so that they can select one of the hotspot maps with the best quality. Using Figure 3 as an example, the hotspot map with the bandwidth parameter b = 500m is the most reasonable as it can discover more hidden patterns.
